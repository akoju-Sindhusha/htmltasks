    <h2>HIDE AND SEEK</h2>

    <P>
     One person is the “hider” and everybody else are the “seekers”. Everyone except the hider close their eyes and count.
     When the counting is done, all the seekers scatter and start searching for the hider. If one player finds the hider, then they join them in their hiding position.
